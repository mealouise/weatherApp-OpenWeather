# Weather application using OpenWeather API

This application using Express & Handlebars allows the user to enter a city which connects to OpenWeather API and returns information such as temperature, country and description for that specific city.

I based the design off the BBC weather app and have made it so that the background image and the icon bath change depending on the 'main' value e.g Clouds, Rain etc.


## Installation

```bash
npm init -y
npm i express express-handlebars
npm i dptenv
npm i node-fetch
npm i body-parser
```
